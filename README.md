# Ilaps
**python data reduction and imaging application for LA-ICP-MS**

## About
LA-ICP-MS is an extremely powerful analytical technique for spatially resolved analysis of solid samples. It produces complex, time-dependent signals which require different approach than signals produced by solution sample introduction. 

Ilaps (**I**maging of **L**aser **a**blation **p**lasma **s**pectrometry) is a python application aimed on data created with laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. It is suited for a spot and line analysis as well as an elemental imaging. The data can be imported directly from mass spectrometry data acquisition as .csv, .asc or .xlsx files.
